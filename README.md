# ThirdWay

`ThirdWay` is a Scala library for building Agent-Based Models (ABMs). 

It started off as a 
[Julia ABM package](https://github.com/jbn/ThirdWay.jl), 
heavily-inspired by 
[MASON](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/). But, Julia 
proved inappropriate for my dissertation. (Although, it is a lovely language!)
In a bout of triage, I switched to Scala, a language I've always 
[evangelized for ABM development](https://github.com/jbn/ScalaOnMason). 
I've come full circle. 

## Contributing 

I have a very good map in my head of what I need for my dissertation. Until 
the map in my head and code in this library sync up, my needs may not be 
clear. And, I won't accept a pull request if it frustrates my project. So, if 
you have a cool idea, open up an issue first. I don't want anyone submitting a 
good PR that gets rejected because I can't use it, yet.
