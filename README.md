`ThirdWay` is a Scala library for building Agent-Based Models (ABMs). 

## History

It started off as a 
[Julia ABM package](https://github.com/jbn/ThirdWay.jl), 
heavily-inspired by 
[MASON](https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/). But, Julia 
proved inappropriate for my dissertation. (Although, it is a lovely language!)
In a bout of triage, I switched to Scala, a language I've always 
[evangelized for ABM development](https://github.com/jbn/ScalaOnMason). 
I've come full circle. 


## Design Principals 

### Readability Matters...A Lot

Agent-based models are inherently complex. Consequently, it's terribly easy to 
introduce computational artifacts. That is, you run your simulation; you 
observe an interesting result; you think it's because that's how what you 
tried to model actually works; but, really, it's because your implementation 
was incorrect. Readability provides some defense. To repurpose Hoare,

> One way [to construct a model] to make it so simple that there are obviously 
> no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there 
> are no obvious deficiencies.

**Readable code tends to simpler to understand**.


### Code Coverage Matters

In the same vein as readability, well-tested code helps guard against 
artifacts. There is a danger evangelizing the 
[One True Methodology](http://programming-motherfucker.com/)Â® protects against 
all regressions and bugs. But, in agent-based modeling, it's not a garnish. 
Again, if the models are inherently complex, code must be verified to ensure 
you know why something happens. 

**As a rule, ThirdWay assumes **a model without good code coverage incorrect 
and bug-ridden. 


### Speed is a Subordinate Concern

That is, it is subordinate, at least with respect to the two prior principals. 
If speed is completely irrelevant, there are much better languages and 
frameworks for designing ABMs. (In particular, if your model is not large, use 
something lighter and more zen-like -- for example, 
[Mesa](https://github.com/projectmesa/mesa).) However, this library assumes 
larger simulations, possibly with very thick agents. As such, speed matters -- 
but, correctness matters more. 

**Any time there is a tradeoff, readability, interoperability, or simplicity 
trumps speed**.


## Contributing 

I have a very good map in my head of what I need for my dissertation. Until 
the map in my head and code in this library sync up, my needs may not be 
clear. And, I won't accept a pull request if it frustrates my project. So, if 
you have a cool idea, open up an issue first. I don't want anyone submitting a 
good PR that gets rejected because I can't use it, yet.
